# NOTE(stephenfin): We must return 0 here. When parsemail is used as a
# delivery command from a mail server like postfix (as it is intended
# to be), a non-zero exit code will cause a bounce message to be
# returned to the user. We don't want to do that for a parse error, so
# always return 0. For more information, refer to
